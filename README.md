# Activity 03 - Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

This activity is intended to be completed in one week - outside of class
preparation work and two 75-minute class meetings. On our Blackboard
course site you were provided with items to read, watch, and do prior to
attempting this activity. Do not proceed in this activity until you have
minimally:

1.  (Day 1 portion) Read *ISL* [Sections 3.2.0 (the chapter
    introduction) & 3.2.1](https://rdcu.be/c3STG).
2.  (Day 2 portion) Read *ISL* [Sections 3.2.2](https://rdcu.be/c3STG).

In this repository/directory, you should see five items:

-   `README-img` - a folder containing images that I am embedding within
    this `README.md` file and other files. You do not need to do
    anything with this.
-   `.gitignore` - a file that is used to specify what Git can ignore
    when pushing to GitHub. You do not need to do anything with this.
-   `README.md` - the document you are currently reading.
-   `day01-fitting` - a folder that contains items for you to complete
    during the first 75-minute class meeting.
    <!-- - `day02-assessing` - a folder that contains items for you to complete during the second 75-minute class meeting.-->

We will explore most of these items over this week. Before doing that,
you will first make your own copy of this repository.

Do you want an interactive way to check your understanding outside of
class? Remember that these are a good way to check your foundation
understanding and were created by [Benjamin
Baumer](https://beanumber.github.io/www/) (associate professor at Smith
College), in collaboration with the OpenIntro team and others. The
following tutorials will provide you with an applied approach to our
topics (reorganized to better correspond with our readings):

Days 1 & 2:

-   *ISL* 3.2 & 3.3 - [Multiple
    regression](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-03-model-08/)

Note that this tutorial covers materials for this week and next week.

## Task 1: Forking & cloning

### Forking

Read these directions first, then work through them. In this GitHub repo
(i.e., my repo):

1.  Click on the ![fork](README-img/fork-icon.png) **Fork** icon near
    the upper-right-hand corner. You will be taken to a **Create a new
    fork** screen.
2.  Verify that your GitHub username is selected under **Owner** and
    that the **Repository name** is `activity03-mlr` with a green check
    mark (this verifies that you do not already have a GitHub repository
    with this name).
3.  You may provide a **Description** if you would like. This is a way
    to provide some additional, more descriptive, meta information
    related to the things you did. I like to provide a brief description
    of what happened.
4.  Verify that **Copy the `main` branch only** is selected.
5.  Click on the green **Create fork** button at the bottom of this
    page.

You should be taken a copy of this repo that is in your GitHub account.
That is, your page title should be `username/activity03-mlr`, where
`username` is replaced with your GitHub username. Directly below this,
you will see the following message:

> forked from
> [gvsu-sta631/activity03-mlr](https://github.com/gvsu-sta631/activity03-mlr)

You will complete the rest of this activity in **your** forked copy of
the `activity03-mlr` repo.

### Cloning

Read these directions first, then work through them. Note that you will
be switching between RStudio and your GitHub repo (that you previously
forked).

1.  In RStudio, click on the
    <img src="../README-img/rproj-icon.png" alt="RStudio Project" width="20"/>
    icon (the icon below the Edit drop-down menu).
2.  Click on **Version Control** on the *New Project Wizard* pop-up.
3.  Click on **Git** and you should be on a "Clone Git Repository" page.
4.  Back to **your** `activity03-mlr` GitHub repo, click on the green
    **Code** button near the top of the page.
5.  Verify that **HTTPS** is underlined in orange/red on the drop-down
    menu, then copy the URL provided.
6.  Back in RStudio, paste the URL in the "Repository URL" text field.
7.  The "Project directory name" text field should have automatically
    populated with `activity03-mlr`. If yours did not (this is usually
    an issue on Macs),

-   Click back into the "Repository URL" text field.
-   Highlight any bit of this text (it does not seem to matter what or
    how much).
-   Press Ctrl/Cmd and the "Project directory name" should now have
    automatically populated with `activity03-mlr`.

1.  In the "Create project as subdirectory of" field, click on
    **Browseâ€¦**. Create a **New Folder** called "STA 631", then within
    this folder, create a **New Folder** called "Activities", then click
    **Choose**. If you already have this, you can simply browse to "STA
    631/Activities", then click **Choose**. Note that I am forcing you
    to use my opinionated file system management style.
2.  Click on **Create Project**.

Your screen should refresh and the **Files** pane should say that you
are currently in your `activity03-mlr` folder that currently has the
same files and folders as your GitHub repo. If you are asked for your
GitHub credentials, provide your GitHub username and your PAT (not your
password).

Take a moment to reflect on what is possibly your second time doing this
forking process.

-   What was easier this time?
-   What is still muddy?
-   What do you need to try/do/explore to help with this muddiness?

## Task 2: One quantitative response variable and two quantitative explanatory variable

We will continue exploring the Human Freedom Index dataset. Recall that
this is a report that attempts to summarize the idea of "freedom"
through a bunch of different variables for many countries around the
globe. It serves as a rough objective measure for the relationships
between the different types of freedom - whether it is political,
religious, economical or personal freedom - and other social and
economic circumstances. The Human Freedom Index is an annually
co-published report by the Cato Institute, the Fraser Institute, and the
Liberales Institut at the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom.

Read these directions first, then work through them.

1.  In your `activity03-mlr` repo folder/directory, locate and click
    into the `day01-fitting` subfolder.
2.  In the `day01-fitting` subfolder, you will be greeted by a new
    `README.md` file. Do your best to complete the tasks/directions
    provide in this subfolder by **11:59 pm (EST) on Tue, Jan 31**.
3.  Ask questions in class as you are working. If you need to finish
    this up outside of our class meetings, remember that you can use our
    Teams workspace (linked on Blackboard), and post questions/issues in
    the **Muddy** channel. If someone else already posted what you
    though was muddy, add any clarification to their post and give them
    a "+ 1" :+1:. Remember that this space is for conversations as well
    as posting questions. Read through your peers' muddy posts and do
    your best to provide help.

The rest of this `README` document contains tasks/directions for the
second class meeting of this week.

## Task 3: TBD

This will be updated on Thu, Feb 2.
